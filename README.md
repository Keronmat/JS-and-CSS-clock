# Javascript and CSS Clock

This clock was design using CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

###### Features

- This project includes an Analog Clock and a Digital Clock.
- The Analog also has a digital display and makes a ticking sound as time passes.
- Background images changes depending of the time of the day.
- The digital clock shows, the date and time.
- The digital clock can set alarm by toggling the bell icon. The alarm can be disabled by toggling the slash bell icon and snooze when the business-time icon is toggled.

###### What I've learnt

- Use Javascript date function to received date and time and manipulate it to get a rotating analog.
- Use Javascript date function to received the current date and time and and minus a set date and time to make use of alarm clock.

###### Error

- `<input type="datetime-local">` is not supported by Mozilla firefox.
